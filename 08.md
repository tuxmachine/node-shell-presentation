# Standard streams

Old school had very simple IO: Keyboard -> [blackbox] -> Monitor

Now, every good developer uses abstraction to create more powerful
functionalities and so the Unix guys conceptualized every IO device
as streams. Hard disk, printer, camera? _streams_. The default
input stream became keyboard, default output stream became the TTY.

Errors are separated into its own output stream to allow users to
capture them differently.
